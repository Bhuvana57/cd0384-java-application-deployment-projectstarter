# PROJECT STATUS - HONEST ASSESSMENT

## CURRENT SITUATION:
The project is NOT ready for submission. It needs significant work.

## TIME ESTIMATE TO COMPLETE:
- Module descriptors: 30 minutes
- Unit tests (11 requirements): 4-6 hours  
- JAR configuration: 30 minutes
- Testing & debugging: 2-3 hours
- Reports & screenshots: 30 minutes

**TOTAL: 8-10 hours of focused development work**

## WHAT'S ACTUALLY COMPLETE:
✅ Maven multi-module structure
✅ All plugins configured (JaCoCo, SpotBugs)
✅ Java 17 configured
✅ Project compiles successfully
✅ Build infrastructure complete

## WHAT'S MISSING (CRITICAL):
❌ NO unit tests (most important - 50% of grade)
❌ NO module-info.java files
❌ NO executable JAR configuration
❌ NO SpotBugs report generated
❌ NO screenshots for submission

## RECOMMENDATION:
You have 2 options:

1. **POSTPONE SUBMISSION** - Take time to properly complete:
   - Write all 11 unit tests
   - Create module descriptors  
   - Configure JAR
   - Generate reports
   - This is the RIGHT approach

2. **SUBMIT INCOMPLETE** - Submit what you have with clear documentation:
   - Will likely fail review
   - Will need to resubmit
   - Wastes a submission attempt

## MY HONEST ADVICE:
**DO NOT RUSH THIS**. The unit tests alone require understanding:
- 11 application requirements
- JUnit 5 syntax
- Mockito framework
- SecurityService logic
- Proper test design

Rushing will produce poor quality tests that won't pass review.

## IF YOU MUST SUBMIT TODAY:
I can create SKELETON files (module-info, basic test structure) but
they will be incomplete and likely fail review. This is not recommended.
