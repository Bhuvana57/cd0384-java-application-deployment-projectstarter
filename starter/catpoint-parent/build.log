# UdaSecurity Project Complete Checklist

## Section 7.2: Update pom.xml
- [ ] Add all missing Maven dependencies
- [ ] Shared dependencies in parent pom
- [ ] Unshared dependencies in child poms
- [ ] Latest versions for core plugins (maven-compiler-plugin, etc.)
- [ ] Project compiles without errors

## Section 7.3: Splitting Up the Project  
- [ ] Create Image-Service module
- [ ] Create Security-Service module
- [ ] Move Image Service code to Image-Service module
- [ ] Move Security code to Security-Service module
- [ ] Create module-info.java for each module with proper exports/requires
- [ ] Handle transitive dependencies
- [ ] Update module dependencies in poms

## Section 7.4: Unit Tests
- [ ] Write unit tests for SecurityService
- [ ] Cover all 5 application requirements:
  1. Alarm armed + sensor activated → pending alarm status
  2. Alarm armed + sensor activated + pending → alarm status
  3. Pending alarm + all sensors inactive → no alarm status
  4. Alarm active + sensor state change (inactive→active) → no state change
  5. Sensor activated + already active + pending → alarm status
  6. Sensor deactivated + already inactive → no alarm state change
  7. Image service returns cat + armed-home → alarm status
  8. Image service returns no cat + sensors inactive → no alarm
  9. System disarmed → no alarm
  10. System armed → reset sensors to inactive
  11. System armed-home + camera shows cat → alarm status

## Section 7.5: Fixing Bugs
- [ ] Identify and fix all bugs found through unit testing
- [ ] All unit tests pass

## Section 7.6: Unit Test Coverage  
- [ ] Achieve minimum coverage requirements
- [ ] Generate code coverage report with JaCoCo
- [ ] Coverage report shows sufficient coverage

## Section 7.7: JAR and Static Analysis
- [ ] Configure maven-assembly-plugin or maven-jar-plugin
- [ ] Build creates executable JAR file
- [ ] Configure SpotBugs plugin
- [] Run static code analysis
- [ ] Address any critical issues found

## Section 7.8: Project Rubric
- [ ] All code compiles and runs
- [ ] Project split into proper modules
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Test coverage meets requirements
- [ ] JAR file builds successfully
- [ ] Static analysis configured
- [ ] All bugs fixed

## Section 7.9: Submit Project
- [ ] Complete README with instructions

# Complete UdaSecurity Project Requirements Analysis

## SECTION 1: Update pom.xml with Missing Dependencies ✓ PARTIALLY DONE
- [x] Project moved to Maven structure  
- [x] Added dependencies to pom.xml
- [x] Project compiles (after fixing Java version)
- [ ] NEED TO CHECK: All dependencies properly configured
- [ ] NEED TO CHECK: Versions specified correctly

## SECTION 2: Split Image Service into Own Module ✓ ALREADY DONE
- [x] Parent project created (catpoint-parent)
- [x] Image-Service module created  
- [x] Security-Service module created
- [x] Components moved to proper modules
- [ ] NEED TO CHECK: Dependencies in parent vs child poms
- [ ] NEED TO CHECK: pluginManagement in parent pom with latest versions
- [ ] NEED TO CHECK: module-info.java exists for each module
- [ ] NEED TO CHECK: Correct export/requires statements
- [ ] NEED TO CHECK: Transitive dependencies handled
- [x] Project still runs

## SECTION 3: Unit Tests - CRITICAL MISSING
### 11 Application Requirements to Test:
1. [ ] Alarm armed + sensor activated → pending alarm
2. [ ] Alarm armed + sensor activated + pending → alarm 
3. [ ] Pending alarm + all sensors inactive → no alarm
4. [ ] Alarm active + sensor state change → no alarm state change
5. [ ] Sensor activated while active + pending → alarm
6. [ ] Sensor deactivated while inactive → no alarm state change
7. [ ] Cat image + armed-home → alarm
8. [ ] No cat image + sensors inactive → no alarm
9. [ ] System disarmed → no alarm
10. [ ] System armed → reset sensors inactive
11. [ ] Armed-home + cat → alarm

### Test Requirements:
- [ ] Use JUnit 5
- [ ] Use @Mock for dependencies
- [ ] Use @ParameterizedTest
- [ ] Use ArgumentMatchers  
- [ ] Create ImageService interface
- [ ] Tests in same package as SecurityService
- [ ] Don't test Repository or ImageService directly

## SECTION 4: Fix Bugs - DEPENDS ON SECTION 3
- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] All 11 requirements properly implemented

## SECTION 5: Unit Test Coverage - MISSING
- [ ] Full coverage of SecurityService methods
- [ ] All application requirement methods covered
- [ ] Generate coverage report
- [ ] Submit coverage screenshots

## SECTION 6: Executable JAR - MISSING
- [ ] Add maven plugin (assembly or jar)
- [ ] Build creates executable JAR
- [ ] JAR runs with: java -jar [jarname]
- [ ] Submit screenshot: executable_jar.png

## SECTION 7: Static Analysis - MISSING  
- [ ] Add spotbugs-maven-plugin to pom
- [ ] Generate spotbugs.html in target/site
- [ ] Fix HIGH priority errors

## SUBMISSION Requirements:
- [ ] Complete README with instructions
- [ ] All required files included
- [ ] Push to GitHub OR zip file
- [ ] Double-check rubric
- [ ] Submit project
